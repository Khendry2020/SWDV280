        <p>Over the past 5 years Scott's Furniture Barn has kept the ideal that one person's junk is another person's treasure. We believe that used furniture
        can still be great furniture, and should not be tossed in a landfill or on the side of the road when they become unwanted. That is were we come in.
        The barn is a one-stop shop to donate your old items and find your new ones. Create an account today to reserve your next favorite household item or 
        donate your unwanted piece, guilt free. We are operating 5 days a week and are centerally located in Ada county and serve Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Eagle and Ontario.</p>

        <p>I spent the early part of my career as a communications officer in the USAF. I worked with computers doing command and control 
        as well as related duties. After leaving the military I worked with a startup company in Austin Texas that was acquired by Hewlett-Packard. 
        This brought me to Boise and I worked as an expert level R&D engineer. I have done consulting work as a developer in many facets of software development.
        While doing my professional endeavors, I also worked as adjunct instructor for several universities such as University of Maryland, Chapman 
        University, National University, and Pikes Peak Community College. I also had a professional photography business that I worked on with my 
        daughter until she decided that having kids was more important than taking pictures! I love the outdoors and spending time with my grandkids.</p>
